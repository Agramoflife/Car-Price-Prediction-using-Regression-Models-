## Geely Auto US Market Entry: Car Pricing Prediction Model

This repository houses the project for **predicting car prices in the US market** for **Geely Auto**, a Chinese automobile company entering the US market. Their goal is to establish a competitive foothold through local manufacturing and understand the unique determinants of car pricing in America.

**Business Goal:**

* Develop a car price prediction model based on readily available independent variables.
* Leverage the model to:
    * Understand how car prices vary based on key features and market trends.
    * Inform design decisions and business strategies to achieve target price points.
    * Gain insights into the US market pricing dynamics for informed decision-making.

**Data:**

* A large dataset of diverse car models across the US market, compiled from market surveys.
* The dataset likely includes features like:
    * Car make and model
    * Technical specifications (engine size, horsepower, fuel efficiency)
    * Features and amenities
    * Body style and dimensions
    * Location and dealership information
    * Pricing data

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Analyze the data for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Clean and preprocess the data for accurate model training.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features relevant to car pricing by analyzing existing data.
3. **Model Selection and Training:** Experiment with various machine learning models (Regression models ) to predict car prices based on the chosen features.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like RMSE and R-squared, adjusted R- squared to identify the best fit for prediction accuracy.
5. **Model Interpretation:** Analyze the model's coefficients and feature importance to understand the key factors influencing car prices.
6. **Visualization and Reporting:** Present the findings in a clear and concise manner using visualizations and reports, highlighting key insights for Geely Auto's management.

**Deliverables:**

* A trained and evaluated car price prediction model.
* A report outlining the model selection, performance, and key findings.
* Visualizations depicting the relationships between features and car prices.
* Code and instructions for running the model and analysis steps.

**Expected Benefits:**

* Geely Auto gains valuable insights into US market car pricing dynamics.
* The model informs strategic decisions on car design, features, and pricing.
* Improved understanding of market competition and potential cost optimization.

**Contributions Welcome:**

I encourage interested individuals to contribute to this project by sharing their expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and car market knowledge.
